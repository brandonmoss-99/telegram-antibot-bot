# By default, your whitelist should be renamed 
# 'whitelist.txt' (excluding the quotes),
# and be in the same directory as bot.py.
# The filename loaded can be modified in the
# configuration file

# Add new groups to your whitelist by
# adding their integer group ID

# Everything including the # line
